# Psych 205 final project

The analysis is conducted in a combination of Python and R using a Jupyter notebook, [analysis.ipynb](/analysis.ipynb). View the paper [here](/paper/paper.pdf) Data shaping and plotting is done in Python, and statistical models are done in R. Unfortunately, you'll have to install several python libraries if you want to run this code yourself. Fortunately, all the code and its corresponding output is visible in the Jupyter notebook.
